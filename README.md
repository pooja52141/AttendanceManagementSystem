# AttendanceManagementSystem

The AMS provides a user-friendly interface for instructors and administrators to manage student attendance and automate the manual process of attendance tracking. The system has three different types of user login, namely Admin, Teacher, and Student. The Admin has the highest level of access, and they are responsible for creating login credentials for teachers and students. Teachers can view attendance, mark attendance, check OD applications, and approve or reject them. Students can view attendance, raise tickets, apply for OD and check application status.
